# *$Product*

*$Product* is a program for *$Task*.
It runs on *$SupportedOperatingSystems*.
This is its home.

## Post-Hostile User License

Hey there! *$Product* does not use telemetry or ads,
and cannot be monetized by selling your identity.
So we're forced to sell *$Product* itself,
the old-fashioned way.

You can buy it completely anonymously
with any of [these 400 cryptocurrencies] [here].
Pay the equivalent of *$Price* and you'll immediately
receive a download link in your browser.

If want to try before you buy, or if the dog ate your backup,
or if you just want This Product for free, hit us up at *charity@$Corp*
This is no joke, we'll happily send you a full working copy of
This Product with no DRM, time limits, or other degradation.
We just need you to tell us a couple of brief sentences about
who you are and what you're up to, and one of our team members
will send you a download link.

Last but not least, feel free to request a free copy of This Product's
source code, licensed under GPLv3. We do not, as a rule, expose a public
development process (GitHub, etc) but may review thoroughly thought out
patch requests.

## Post-Hostile Privacy Policy

We do insist on receiving any feedback, bug reports, war stories, etc,
that you may have. So we keep the right to store your email address
in our privacy-friendly vendor [$VendorPrivacyPolicy]'s infrastructure,
and to email you to ask if This Product is useful to you, and related offers.
(No spam or marketing, no newsletters or forms, only the occasional
human beings caring if they're doing a good job!)
